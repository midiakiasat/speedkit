# Deprecation Policy

## Statement

**DEPRECATION: NEVER**

## Meaning

- speedkit.eu URLs will remain valid indefinitely
- No URL will be removed or redirected to a different resource
- No system will be de-listed from the index

## Additions

New systems may be added. This does not affect existing entries.

## Modifications

Existing entries may be updated for:
- Factual corrections
- Status changes (e.g., "live" → "discontinued")
- Link updates

Modifications must be:
- Append-only in spirit (corrections, not deletions)
- Documented in git history

## Enforcement

The index CI enforces append-only semantics.
Deletions will fail CI checks.
